Welcome to Graphs!
This is a Python project that contains a Graph class that allows several functionallity on undirected, non weighted, simple graphs, such as adding edges, vertices, plotting (leveraging the networkx module) and retrieve the Adjency and Laplacian Graph matrices.
I created the project to study spectral graph theory,as it is of great convinience having methods within a graph class that gives you Matrix Graph representations. 
However, it is an open project so perhaps it could also be extended to other functionallity like algorithms (deep firs/bread first), or machine/deep learning approaches.
